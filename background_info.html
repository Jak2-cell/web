<h2> Background Info</h2>
<div class = "intro">
<p>The Taking of the Pelham 123 was produced in 2009 and is a remake of a movie of the same name produced in 1974.</p>
<p>It stars some famous actors and actresses including John Travolta and James Gandolfini. </p>
<p>The movie takes place in New York City, and the name of the movie comes from the train that is being robbed in it. This train is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_(New_York_City_Subway_service)">6 train</a> departing from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelham_Bay_Park_station">Pelham Bay Park Station</a> at 1:23 PM. </p>
<p>The budget for the film was around $100 million dollars. It's box office $150 million, so it did pretty well economically.</p>
<p> The movie was directed by Tony Scott, who was an English film director and producer who sadly suicided 3 years after the movie came out in 2012. </p>
<p> John Travolta, one of the big actors that partook in the film, did not actively participate in promoting the film since it was around this time that his 16 year old son Jet died. John Travolta did not think that he was ready to get back into the spotlight by promoting the film.</p>
<p> Probably one of the most tragic and most significant occurences that happened in New York, if not the United States, or the world, happened between when the original classic from 1974 came out and when the 2009 remake came out. This occurence was the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p> Because of just how much 9/11 changed New York, suttle differences had to be made between the classic and the remake. </p>
<p> The sheer technological differences between the 1970's and the 2000's also caused some changes between the remake and the classic.</p>
