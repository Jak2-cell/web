<p>The Taking of the Pelham 123 was produced in 2009 and is a remake of a movie of the same name produced in 1974.</p>
<p>It stars some famous actors and actresses including John Travolta and James Gandolfini. </p>
<p>The movie takes place in New York City, and the name of the movie comes from the train that is being robbed in it. This train is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_(New_York_City_Subway_service)">6 train</a> departing from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelham_Bay_Park_station">Pelham Bay Park Station</a> at 1:23 PM. </p>
