<h2> Background Info</h2>
<p>The Taking of the Pelham 123 was produced in 2009 and is a remake of a movie of the same name produced in 1974.</p>
<p>It stars some famous actors and actresses including John Travolta and James Gandolfini. </p>
<p>The movie takes place in New York City, and the name of the movie comes from the train that is being robbed in it. This train is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_(New_York_City_Subway_service)">6 train</a> departing from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelham_Bay_Park_station">Pelham Bay Park Station</a> at 1:23 PM.

<h2> Plot </h2> 
<p> A group of criminals hijack the 6 train at 77th Street Station, and take the passengers onboard the train hostage. The hijackers demand a 10 million dollar ransom to be paid within an hour, and say that one hostage will be killed for every minute that the money is late. The vehicle carrying the ransom gets into an accident, and as a result, the money is late.</p>
<p> The hijackers threaten to kill the mother of a kid on board the train, however, a veteran sacrifices his life instead, and is shot dead. All the time while, the hijackers are speaking on the phone to a train dispatcher and request that he come to the train to deliver the ransom money. </p>
<p> By now, the stock stock market had taken a severe hit, and the hijackers had made enormous profits on it. </p>
<p> The hijackers make the train dispatcher, who secretly has a gun, operate the train to a tunnel, where both the hijackers and the dispatcher depart through the tunnels while leaving the train to operate at full speed without the possibility of stopping it. In the tunnels, the dispatcher espapes from the hijackers, who eventually get to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_Astoria_New_York">Waldorf Astoria Hotel</a>. </p>
<p> The main hijacker, Ryder, separates from the other two hijackers with him, both of whom are shot dead by the police after a gunfight. Meanwhile, the train that was hijacked is successfully stopped before crashing into anything. Ryder gets a taxi and makes it upto the Manhattan Bridge, where he is met with the dispatcher. With police surrounding him and his plot failed, he forces the dispatcher to shoot him dead. </p>
<p> The dispatcher then goes home to his family with groceries his wife asked him to pick up after being complemented and called a hero. </p>

<h2> Rating </h2>
<p> I personally really enojyed the movie and would give it a 9 out of 10, one point being taken off for some of it's inaccuracies. </p>
<p> Rotten Tomatoes gave it a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1207149-taking_of_pelham_1_2_3">51%</a> on the Tomatometer. </p>
