<h3><div class = "intro"> This website is all about the 2009 movie "The Taking of the Pelham 123". I watched this movie around 3 years ago and it is one of my favorite movies. There is a lot of suspence, action, and surprise. But what I have to say most intriguied me about this movie is it's setting. It is set in the tunnels of the New York Subway, and it is cool to watch the movie occur in a place I am so familiar with. I recommend not only all New Yorkers, but everyone in the world, to watch this gem of a movie. If you're looking into watching this movie, this site contains information about it's basic setting as well as background info and reviews.</div></h3>
