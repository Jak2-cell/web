<p> I personally really enojyed the movie and would give it a 9 out of 10, one point being taken off for some of it's inaccuracies. </p>
<p> What do I mean by inaccuracies? Well, you see, when I was younger, I was very interested in the New York City Subway, and would spend a lot of time remembering all of the stations, lines and tracks. </p>
<p> Although I'm not as interested in the Subway nowadays, I still remember a lot of information that I learned from when I was interested. </p>
<p> That's why seeing a 6 train somehow ending up on the D train line in South Brooklyn was very disturbing to me. </p>
<p> The numbered and lettered trains were built by different companies before being conjoined into what we all know today as the MTA. Because competition was so fierce back then, the different companies made their trains and train tracks very incompatible with each other.</p>
<p> That's why you don't see numbered trains running alongside lettered trains, even to this day.</p>
<p> What I'm getting at is that it is pretty inprobable that the 6 train would've ended up on the D train.</p>
<p> Besides for these small inaccuracies that most people, especially if they're from outside of New York, won't know, the movie is amazing.
<p> There is a lot of action including shooting, running, and wild car accidents, as well as nail-biting suspence, and movie-changing surprises throughout.</p>
<p> Rotten Tomatoes gave it a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1207149-taking_of_pelham_1_2_3">51%</a> on the Tomatometer. </p>
<p> But what does Rotten Tomatoes know?! You truly gotta see it for yourself. If you don't like the movie after watching it, fine. But I doubt this will happen.</p> </div> </div>
